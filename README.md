# OVI

Final project for "Introducion al Desarrollo de Software"

Its name comes from the resemblance of "OVNI" but with the difference that these objects are identified. On this small page you will find some models of planes, helicopters and what planes are operated by some airlines that provide flights over Argentina.

Made by Ivan Emanuel Fabregat, 112287.
